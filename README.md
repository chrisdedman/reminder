## Reminder
This project is automate a reminder for boring stuff. I create this algorithm to keep in track the training of my puppy.<br>
You will have to add your personnal song in the code timer.py . Every time you set up a reminder, the program save (append not erase) your data in the history file, to keep in track what you are doing every day.

## Setup

Download the following files:
* history_reminder.txt
* timer_version2.py

## Additional Information
If you try the timer.py under Linux Ubuntu 20.4, the AppKit doesn't work (*for me), I wrote some instruction in the script pay attention to it.
