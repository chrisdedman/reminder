This project is automate a reminder for boring stuff.
Like in this case, reminder for when to go for a walk with my dog for exemple.

# ______________________________________

Timer Version 2 is an update (I get little more knowladge since a started this project) and you're now able to set up 
a specifique time directly into the terminal command, no needed to change the code anymore.
I let you discovert that by yourself. 
I hope it will help you.

Download the following files:
- history_reminder.txt
- timer_version2.py

keep those two file in the same repository (don't forgot to add your personnal song in the code timer_version2.py)
Every time you set up a reminder, the program save (append not erase) your data in the history file, you keep in track what you are doing every day.
If you try the timer_version2 under Linux Ubuntu 20.4, the AppKit doesn't (*for me), I wrote some instruction in the script pay attention to it.
