This project is automate a reminder for boring stuff.
Like in this case, reminder for when to go for a walk with my dog for exemple.

Timer Version 2 is an update (I get little more knowladge since a started this project) and you're now able to set up 
a specifique time directly into the terminal command, not needed to change the code anymore.
I let you discovert that by yourself. 
I hope it will help you.
